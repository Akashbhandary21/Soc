DISCHARGING STATUS OF BATTERY FOR EV APPLICATION”
# ABSTRACT
Electric vehicles are set to be the dominant form of transportation in the near future and Lithium-based
rechargeable battery packs have been widely adopted in them. Battery packs need to be constantly monitored and
managed in order to maintain the safety, efficiency and reliability of the overall electric vehicle system. A battery
management system consists of a battery fuel gauge, optimal charging algorithm, and cell/thermal balancing
circuitry. It uses three non-invasive measurements from the battery, voltage, current and temperature, in order to
estimate crucial states and parameters of the battery system, such as battery impedance, battery capacity, state of
charge, state of health, power fade, and remaining useful life. These estimates are important for the proper
functioning of optimal charging algorithms, charge and thermal balancing strategies, and battery safety
mechanisms. Approach to robust battery management consists of accurate characterization, robust estimation of
battery states and parameters, and optimal battery control strategies. This paper describes some recent approaches
developed by the authors towards developing a robust battery management system.
# INTRODUCTION
Transport sector dependent mostly on oil and fuel, which their prices are unstable and their reserves are severely
depleted. Moreover, the use of these forms of energy pollutes the environment and causes the emission of
greenhouse gases. Much research has been interested by the economic efficiency of the integration of electric
vehicles. They present an overview of the impact of the increasing penetration of the EV into vehicle market.
Focusing of the electricity system and the emergence of vehicle to grid technologies, batteries and EV recharge
infrastructure conclude the need for standardization to facilitate safe transition with economically efficient and
environmentally abiding. And estimate costs of plug-in electric vehicles and their work shows the advantages of
smart electric vehicles compared to the dumb electrical vehicles which that appear most in timing of charging and
discharging of EVs. To improve vehicle performance various researches, deal with the optimization of energy
management for the new generation of vehicle Battery is one of the energy storage management systems in EV.
The battery provide power when vehicle accelerating and absorb power when vehicle braking. So the cruse range
and accelerate performance depend on the battery. Usually, there is a battery management system (BMS) in
battery pack of vehicles. The BMS monitor the statues of the battery, and communicates with vehicle control unit
(VCU), to ensure the battery not in abused, such as over-charged, over discharged or over-temperature. And BMS
play a vital role in hybrid and electric applications, since the importance of BMS have a significant impact on the
energy efficiency and the battery’s life.
